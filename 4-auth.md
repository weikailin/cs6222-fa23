Authentication
================

In this section, we will discuss digital methods which make
it difficult to “forge” a “signature.” Just as with encryption, there
are two different approaches to the problem based on whether
private keys are allowed: message authentication codes and digital
signatures. Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are used in
the private key setting. Only people who know the secret key
can check if a message is valid. Digital Signatures extend this
idea to the public key setting. Anyone who knows the public key
of Alice can verify a signature issued by Alice, and only those
who know the secret key can issue signatures. [Ps, p133]

Message Authentication Codes (MAC)
-------------------------

#### **Definition:** MAC

{:.defn}
> $(\Gen, \Tag, \Ver)$ is a message authentication code (MAC) over 
> the message space $\set{\cM_n}_n$ if the following syntax, correctness, and security hold:
> 
> - $\Gen$ is a PPT algorithm that returns a key $k \gets \Gen(1^n)$.
> - $\Tag$ is a PPT algorithm that on input key $k$ and message $m$ outputs a tag $\sigma \gets \Tag_k(m)$.
> - $\Ver$ is a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that on input $k, m$ and $\sigma$ 
>   outputs “accept” or “reject”.
> 
> Correctness: For all $n \in\N$, for all $m \in \cM_n$,
> 
> $$
> \Pr[k \gets \Gen(1^n) : \Ver_k(m, \Tag_k(m)) = \taccept] = 1.
> $$

> \Pr\left[

> \begin{array}{l}

Discuss:

- The adversary $A$ is allowed to oracle query $\Tag_k$. Is that too strong as $A$ gets too much info?
- The adversary $A$ aims to forge a tag for *arbitrary message* $m$. Is that too strong since useful messages are not arbitrary?
- Can this definition defend against an adversary that *replay* a (message, tag) pair? Replay can be a devastating attack in many applications, such as financial transactions.
- If we additionally give the adversary oracle access to verification $\Ver_k$, is the definition stronger?
- Does the existence of MAC imply the existence of OWF? If so, what's the construction?

#### **Construction:** MAC

{:.defn}
> Let $F = \set{ f_s}$ be a family of pseudorandom functions such that 
> $f_s : \bit^{|s|} \to \bit^{|s|}$.
> 
> - $\Gen(1^n): k \gets \bit^n$.
> - $\Tag_k(m)$: Output $f_k(m)$.
> - $\Ver_k(m, \sigma)$: Ouptut “accept” if and only if $f_k(m) = \sigma$.

#### **Theorem:**

{:.theorem}
> If there exists a pseudorandom function, then the above scheme is a 
> Message Authentication Code over the message space $\bit^n$.

{:.proof-title}
> Proof Sketch:
> 
> The correctness is direct, and the security is argued below.
> 
> Consider a hybrid scheme and the corresponding hybrid experiment such that
> a random function $RF$ is used instead of the PRF $f_k$.
> The hybrid scheme is indistinguishable from the real construction
> by the oracle indistinguishability of PRF and then by a standard reduction
> (for any NUPPT adversary).
> Next, in the hybrid experiment, we claim that any adversary 
> can only win with probability at most $2^{-n}$:
> if the adversary queries $m$, it is rejected;
> otherwise, the adversary can only output $\sigma = RF(m)$ w.p. $2^{-n}$
> (for even unbounded adversaries).

#### From fixed-length to arbitrary length

The above definition and construction consider MAC for messages in space $\cM_n$ so that
the length is fixed.
Of course, to handle arbitrarily long messages,
we can instantiate the PRF in the construction with a PRF scheme of arbitrary length.
However, existing
practical pseudorandom functions (i.e., block ciphers) take short, ﬁxed-length inputs.
It is necessary in practice to handle some subtleties, and this is called "domain extension" in general.

1. Split a long message into a sequence of short "blocks" and then $\Tag$ each.
2. Include a sequence number into each block (to prevent reordering attack).
3. Append to every block the total length (to prevent truncation attack).

There are other approaches, such as CBC-MAC (which is *only secure when* 
the message length is "ﬁxed and agreed upon in advance", see [KL, Exercise 4.13]).
We skip the details of the constructs.

Digital Signature Schemes
-------------------------

> With message authentication codes, both the signer and verifier need to share a secret key.
> In contrast, digital signatures mirror real-life signatures in that anyone who knows Alice 
> (but not necessarily her secrets) can verify a signature generated by Alice.
> Moreover, digital signatures possess the property of *non-repudiability*, 
> i.e., if Alice signs a message and sends it to Bob, 
> then Bob can prove to a third party (who also knows Alice) the validity of the signature. 
> Hence, digital signatures can be used as certificates in a public key infrastructure.

#### **Definition:** Digital Signatures

{:.defn}
> $(\Gen, \Sign, \Ver)$ is a digital signature scheme over the message space $\set{\cM_n}_n$ 
> if the following syntax, correctness, and security are satisfied:
> 
> - $\Gen(1^n)$ is a PPT which on input $n$ outputs a public key $\pk$ and a secret key $\sk$: $\pk, \sk \gets \Gen(1^n)$. 
> - $\Sign$ is PPT algorithm which on input a secret key $\sk$ and message $m \in \cM_n$ 
>   outputs a signature $\sigma$: $\sigma \gets \Sign_\sk(m)$.
> - $\Ver$ is a deterministic poly-time algorithm which on input a public key $\pk$, 
>   a message $m$ and a signature $\sigma$ returns either “accept” or “reject”.
> 
> Correctness:
> For all $n \in \N$, for all $m \in \cM_n$,
> 
> $$ 
> \Pr[\pk, \sk \gets \Gen(1^n) : \Ver_\pk(m, \Sign_\sk(m)) = \taccept] = 1
> $$
> 
> Security:
> For all NUPPT adversaries $A$, there exists a negligible function $\eps(n)$ such that
> $\forall n \in \N$,
>

> \Pr\left[
> \begin{array}{l}
> \pk,\sk \gets \Gen(1^n);\\
> (m, \sigma) \gets A^{\Sign_\sk(\cdot)}(1^n, \pk)
> \end{array}
>  ~:~
> \begin{array}{l}
> A \text{ did not not query } m \text{, and }\\ 
> \Ver_\pk(m, \sigma) = \taccept
> \end{array}
> \right] \le \eps(n)
> $$

Note that the definition is a public-key version of MAC. 
Also, since the verification uses only public key, $A$ can perform verification without oracle queries.
