Zero Knowledge Proofs
=====================

What is information?
What is knowledge?

- Alice sends to Bob the string $0^n$
- Alice sends to Bob the string $s = 3.14159...$, $n$ bits
- Alice sends to Bob the encryption of $s$ without a key

Shannon's information theory is relevant, but here we consider 
"knowledge" (instead of information) in the context of *computational aspects*. 

Example:
the encrypted message is zero-knowledge to the adversary who has no key
because the encryption can be simulated by the adversary itself!

#### **Definition:** Zero-Knowledge Encryption

{:.defn}
> A private-key encryption scheme $(\Gen, \Enc, \Dec)$ is zero-knowledge encryption scheme 
> if there exists a PPT simulator algorithm $S$ such that 
> $\forall$ NUPPT $D$, $\exists$ a negligible function $\eps(n)$, such that 
> $\forall m \in \bit^n$ it holds that $D$ distinguishes the following distributions 
> with probability at most $\eps(n)$:
> 
> - $\set{k \to \Gen(1^n) : \Enc_k(m)}$
> - $\set{S(1^n)}$

Discuss: what if we allow $S$ to take exponential time (in $n$)?

#### **Theorem:**

{:.theorem}
> $(\Gen, \Enc, \Dec)$ is secure if and only if it is zero-knowledge.

See [Ps, Sec 4.2] for proof.

Interactive Proofs
------------------

We consider interactions between *interactive* Turing machines (ITM) that run in multiple *rounds*.
Each ITM has the following tapes:

- Input tape, read only
- Auxiliary input tape, read only (we will see later why it is needed)
- Working tape, allowing both read/write 
- Sending tape, write only
- Receiving tape, read only
- Output tape, write only

In each round, the ITM reads from input + aux + receive tapes, performs computation on working tape, 
and then writes to sending / output tape.

A *protocol* between two ITMs $(A,B)$ is the computation performed by $(A,B)$ through rounds,
where the sending tape of $A$ is the receiving tape of $B$ and vice versa.
In each round, only one ITM is active.

Transcript: all messages sent by both $(A,B)$ during the execution of the protocol.

Random execution: both $A$ and $B$ can be randomized and takes randomness (ie random tapes) $r_a$ and $r_b$ correspondingly.

Outputs: each ITM in the protocol may halt and write to its output tape.
We denote $\out_A[A(x_a, z_a, r_a) \leftrightarrow B(x_b, z_b, r_b)]$ as the output of $A$
when the inputs $x_a, x_b$, aux inputs $z_a, z_b$, and randomness $r_a, r_b$ are given to $A$ and $B$ correspondingly.
We similarly denote $\out_B[A(x_a, z_a, r_a) \leftrightarrow B(x_b, z_b, r_b)]$ as the output of $B$.
We analogously use the random varialbe $\out_A[A(x_a, z_a) \leftrightarrow B(x_b, z_b)]$ as the output of $A$
(and $\out_B$ similarly) if the random tapes are randomized.

Views: fixing inputs $x_a, x_b$, aux inputs $z_a, z_b$, and randomness $r_a, r_b$,
the transcript of the execution between $A(x_a, z_a, r_a)$ and $B(x_b, z_b, r_b)$ is fixed.
We denote the *view* of $A$ as $\view_B[A(x_a, z_a, r_a) \leftrightarrow B(x_b, z_b, r_b)]$,
which consists of

- $x_a, z_a, r_a$
- the receiving tape (for all rounds of communication)

Similarly, if the ITMs are randomized, the transcript is a random variable (depends on $r_a, r_b$),
and we write the random variable $\view_A[A(x_a, z_a) \leftrightarrow B(x_b, z_b)]$.
The view of $B$ is denoted as $\view_B[A(x_a, z_a) \leftrightarrow B(x_b, z_b)]$ symmetrically.

#### **Definition:** Interactive Proof

{:.defn}
> A pair of ITMS $(P, V)$ is an *interactive proof system* for a language $L$ 
> if $V$ is a PPT machine and the follwing properties hold. 
> 
> 1. (Completeness) For every $x \in L$, there exists a witness string $y \in \bit^\ast$ 
>    such that for every auxiliary string $z$:
> 
>    $$
>    \Pr \left[\out_V [P(x, y) \leftrightarrow V(x, z)] = 1 \right] = 1
>    $$
> 
> 2. (Soundness) There exists some negligible function $\eps$ such that for all $x \notin L$ and 
>    for all (adversarial) prover algorithms $P^\ast$, and all auxiliary strings $z \in \bit^\ast$,
> 
>    $$
>    \Pr \left[\out_V [P^\ast(x) \leftrightarrow V(x, z)] = 0 \right] \gt 1 âˆ’ \eps(|x|)
>    $$

Notice: both the honest $P$ and the malicious $P^\ast$ are allowed to be unbounded and non-uniform.
That is, inefficient prover.

Complexity:
The class of languages having an interactive proofs is denoted $IP$.
It is direct to see that $NP \subset IP$ as $V$ is PPT.
It is proved that $IP = PSPACE$.

It is natural to consider IP in crypto setting 
because one party may want to achieve more than what's given by the completeness.
