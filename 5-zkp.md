Zero Knowledge Proofs
=====================

What is information?
What is knowledge?

- Alice sends to Bob the string $0^n$
- Alice sends to Bob the string $s = 3.14159...$, $n$ bits
- Alice sends to Bob the encryption of $s$

Shannon's information theory is relevant, but here we consider 
"knowledge" (instead of information) in the context of *computational aspects*. 

Example:
a encrypted message is zero-knowledge to the adversary who has no key
because the encryption can be simulated by the adversary itself!
